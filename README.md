# nextPallindrome
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of units that can be read the same way in either direction, with general allowances for adjustments to punctuation and word dividers. For a positive integer P of not more than 1000000 digits, write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than P to output. (Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.) Ensure that the assignment is submitted with working test cases
